# Purpose
For basics on how to use the machine, please go to [[Introduction to Using the Machine]] and the [[Hamilton Run Guide]]

The Hamilton Spiking Sheet is used to generate a worklist for the machine to read. This worklist will allow the Hamilton Starlet machine to utilize the Spiking Scheme method to create spikes for laboratory use.


## How to Create the Spiking Sheet
1. Open up the Spiking Template Excel file
2. Fill in the respective cells, use the notebook spiking scheme as a guide. 
3. Cells labeled *Carrier* and *Position* refer to the volume of the container the sample is in and the location on the Hamilton respecitvely.
4. Once everything is filled out, click the ==Create Spiking Sheet== button. This will produce the worklist in
```py
"T:\BPS\General\Equipment\EQ1846 (Hamilton Starlet)\TEST Macro"
```

## How to Use the Spiking Worklist
1. Using the Hamilton, run the Spiking Scheme Protocol method
2. Run through the program following the directions until you reach a prompt asking you to submit a spiking scheme
3. Select the spiking scheme from the above folder location
